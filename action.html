        <img class="smallimage" src="eternals.jpg" alt="filmposter">
        <p class="welcome">The new Eternals film is meant to start a new saga of the Marvel Cinematic Universe<strong>(MCU)</strong>. There have been mixed reviews about this film however, with an A-list cast, there were very high expections and most believe these expections were not met. The MCU has created its own path and this particular piece of cinema is very underwhelming. 5/10.</p>
