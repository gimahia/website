        <p class="welcome">Dwayne Johnson once again blesses our screens as the highest paid actor in 2021, it is very well deserved. This comedy follows the story of an unlikely trio who work together to find the fabrige eggs hidden around the world. Comical genius Ryan Reynolds compliments his infamous charm to that of Gal Gadot. 7/10.</p>

        <p class="welcome">Encanto is a great faily film with amazing values within the film and a unique storyline to grace our screens. The diversification within this film is impeccable and makes everybody feel included and needed, a great film for showing young people their worth and instilling it at a young age. I'm definitely a fan. 8.5/10.</p>

        <img class="smallimage" src="vacationfriends.jpg" alt="filmposter">
        <p class="welcome">This film is weird. No sugarcoating it, but it is weirdly entertaining. We follow a black couple who have gone on vacation and come across a very eccentric, no boundary having couple who give the black couple a very eventful trip they definitely won't forget. A must watch, 6/10.</p>
