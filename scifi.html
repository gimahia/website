        <p class="welcome">Although not a recent film, I felt I needed to included this one to give it the recognition it deserves. From the early work of Asa Butterfield, this cinematic masterpiece follows a young boy who believes to be helping his planet but not all is as it seems. 8.5/10.</p>

        <p class="welcome">The long awaited and anticipated origin of the Russian spy, part of the Avengers team, finally aired in 2021. We follow Natasha Romanoff's life and how she grew to be worthy enough to be part of the Avengers- being one of the only normal humans, aside from Hawkeye. A lovely watch, 6.5/10.</p>

        <img class="smallimage" src="dontlookup.jpg" alt="filmposter">
        <p class="welcome">All-Star cast. This film was amazingly executed with a perfectly balanced mixture of comedy, gloom, romance, sci-fi and much more. Adam Mckay hit jackpot with his involvement in this blockbuster. 9/10.</p>
